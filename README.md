# ðŸŒŸ SuperConsole 
**SuperConsole** is a Windows console based on [ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu), [MSYS2](https://github.com/msys2), [Zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh), [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git), [grml-zsh-config](https://grml.org/zsh/), [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and [agkozak-zsh-theme](https://github.com/agkozak/agkozak-zsh-prompt) projects, customized and configured for everyday use.

## List of customizations (so far):
  * Pre-configured ConEmu with my favourite settings (see post-install/ConEmu.xml)
  * ConEmu/zsh out-of-the-box configured to restore previously opened tabs and shell working directories after ConEmu restart
  * Choose between clean and inherited environment when start new SuperConsole session
  * Custom colorful scheme, SourceCodePro mono font, colorful output for various commands
  * MSYS2 included, zsh and necessary software preinstalled, used zsh-grml-config
  * Git-for-Windows repo with proper git and git lfs support for MSYS2 environment is configured, git client already installed.
  * ssh-agent for git works out-of-box, add your keys to ConEmu/msys64/ConEmu/msys64/home/user/.ssh dir
  * Non-blocking zsh prompt status updates thanks to agkozak-zsh-prompt
  * Customized for MSYS2 command-not-found handler suggests what package to install
  * Set up nano as main editor, enabled nano syntax highlighting
  * Custom helper scripts added to ConEmu/msys64/3rdparty, oh-my-zsh sources downloaded there, so you make use of needed plugins by sourcing them in .zshrc
